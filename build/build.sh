# To install typescript compiler (tsc) run these commands:
#
# Note: TSC Version 1.8.10, is the version i ended up with first time doing this.
# (Once you already have NODE, installed and you perhaps want to just upgrade TSC version, you can 
# just run the 'nmp install' shown here, and not the lines above it.
#
# Warning: Whenever you do update 'typescript' using the 'nmp install' below, you probably want to 
# also go manually download and update the copy of 'system.js' you have in your source
# folder of meta64, because using versions of typescript and system.js that are incompatable will 
# cause failures that are extremely hard to diagnose.
#
#    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
#    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
#    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
#    sudo npm install -g typescript
#    read -p "TypeScript install complete."
#
# Update: now that typescript 2.1 is out I did this to update to it:
#    sudo npm install -g typescript@latest
#    tsc -v
#    read -p "TypeScript updated?"
#
#    If version still reports wrong after install, delete all these and try again..
#    delete /usr/bin/tsc
#           /usr/local/bin/tsc
#           /usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript

# To install WEBPACK
# (I experimented with webpack, and decided not to use it for now. TypeScript is capable of making a bundled file 
#  and that bundling of my own code is all I need for now)
#  I'm leaving these webpack commands in here just for future reference:
#
#     sudo npm install -g webpack
#     npm install --save-dev typescript awesome-typescript-loader source-map-loader
#     read -p "WebPack install complete."
#
#   Note: in the above you DO need 'typescipt' in the command even if you already have it, because --save-dev is there.      
#
# NOTE: awesome-typescript-loader is not the only loader for typescript. You could instead use ts-loader.
#       see: https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#differences-between-ts-loader
