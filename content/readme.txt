NOTE: About the files contained in this folder and direct subfolders.

The SystemView.XML file should be imported to "/meta64/public/help", in order to make application help menu work. The help menu works by simply pointing the user to this location and letting them view the help documentation as online nodes, just like any other content in the system.

NOTE: Don't forget to make this node 'public' in the sharing dialog so that everyone can see it. Currently the software doesn't force this although arguably we should make it automaticaly publish.
