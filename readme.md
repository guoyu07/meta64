### Status as of 8/23/2017

Conversion underway, removing JCR. Switching to MongoDB.

Actually linode.com shut down my server for some routine maintenance and I haven't restarted it yet because I'm in the middle of converting JCR to MongoDB, and so it will be a few more days before I have the sbnode.com instance back up.

The codebase is largely a mess right now during this transition (converting to MongoDB). The codebase is very functional at this point but only if you know what you can and can't do so I recommend no other developers try using this about 9/1/2017 which is when I will have the redesigned site back up and running. For anyone coming here looking at the code just keep in mind this is in the middle of a massive redesign so there are shortcuts, and hacks in the code at the moment, and massive chunks of code still commented out that have not yet been converted from JCR to MongoDB.
